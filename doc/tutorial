Plot renders a theatrical lighting plot into a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)
drawing.

The lighting plot is described in an XML file.

The base element is called "plot" and currently has no attributes.

In creating a specific plot, it makes sense to start with the venue in general,
and in particular to build our plot around the stage. (This approach needs to
be modified when the stage is a temporary structure, but we'll get back to that
later.)

Here is a simple stage, 22 feet wide and 11 feet deep.
I'm specifying sizes in inches because it simplifies other processing.

<plot>
  <stage depth="132" width="264" />
</plot>

By default, the coordinate system of the venue has its origin at the front
center of the stage, with measurements along the X-axis increasing as one goes
towards stage left and measurements along the Y-axis increasing in the
direction of upstage. Vertical measurements start at the stage surface, so in
venues with stadium seating that starts below the stage level, the audience (at
least the front part) is at a negative value for Z.


A boom with a single vertical pipe can be specified like so:

<plot>
  <stage depth="132" width="264" />
  <boom>
    <base id="a76" x="-240" y="-240" z="-24" />
      <pipe id="v1" length="144" >
    </pipe>
  </boom>
</plot>

The base is placed at specified coordinates. I'm presuming a standard 50-pound
cast iron base, or at least something of that approximate dimension, threaded
in the center for a pipe. The pipe contained within a base description is
attached to that base.


TODO:
  - I shouldn't need to put an ID into a base, but it will require generating
    IDs internally for bases that do not have an ID.
  - I shouldn't need to put an ID into a pipe, but it will require generating
    IDs internally for pipes that do not have an ID. (And then such pipes will
    not be able to be referenced.)



The functionality so far exposed in this tutorial is only a small part of the
what Plot is capable of. Most of that functionality requires the use of an
arcane specification language that is being replaced with XML. One could likely
figure out how to use that by digging into the source code but understand that
it is entirely unsupported and deprecated and will be removed as soon as
possible.

I would love to hear from people who try to use Plot. Hearing what missing
features are roadblocks for others will help me prioritize what to work on
next.





  <boom id="bl">
    <base id="b2" x="240" y="-240" z="-24" />
    <pipe id="v2" base="b2" length="144" >
      <luminaire model="Source Four" lens="50" location="72" spin="135" />
    </pipe>
  </boom>

For a proscenium stage, 

<plot>
  <stage depth="322" width="780" >
    <proscenium width="483" height="212" depth="13" />
    <apron width="624" depth="144" />
  <stage/>
</plot>
